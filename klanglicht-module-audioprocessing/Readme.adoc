== Description

This little library is based on Damien Quartz' project minim which is a module for the processing framework.

Processing modules are a bit special because they expect to work in the UI environment of processing and therefore have certain preliminaries which are not helpful when to be used as a pure library.

In my twinkly project I wanted to leverage from the high level audio processing features of minim such as FFT so I decided to boil down Damiens code to what I really need and of course port it to Kotlin on the way.
